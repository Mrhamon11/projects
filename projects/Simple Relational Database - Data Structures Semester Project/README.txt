Test main method is stored in "Semester Project\src\main\java\testing\TestClass". This class tests the functionalilty of the database. 

This project supports "Create Table", "Insert", "Update", "Create Index", "Delete", and "Select" SQL statements.

Comments are present above each line in the database file explaining what is going on. 

If at any point, you want to rerun the tests, or start fresh on the database, delete the "Semester Project\Semester Project\src\logging" folder. 
The program will recreate it and the db will be wiped clean. 

A GUI for the program can also be found in "Semester Project\src\main\java\database\GUI". Either "true" or "false" 
will be displayed in the box depending on whether or not the SQL command was valid, and it will display the table
when a select statement is made.
