/**
 * Class BoxBall - a graphical ball that observes the effect of gravity. The ball
 * has the ability to move. Details of movement are determined by the ball itself. It
 * will fall downwards, accelerating with time due to the effect of gravity, and bounce
 * upward again when hitting the ground. It will also bounce off of walls and the ceiling
 * like a ball would in real life.
 *
 * This movement can be initiated by repeated calls to the "move" method. The "move" method 
 * was updated by Avraham Amon to determine how the ball reacts when coming in contact with
 * the lines that define walls.
